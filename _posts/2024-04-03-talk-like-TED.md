I approached this book with the intention of grasping and detecting some of the most important secrets while speaking in front of people and "Talk like TED" has definitely not disapppointed me.

While analysing and drawing common points among some of the best and most famous TED talk of recent history, Gallo provides some invaluable insights and practical techniques for anyone looking to enhance their public speaking skills.

The book itself tries to be the the Dale Carnegie's XXI version of the 1915 _The Art of Public Speaking_ and gives concrete examples of techniques and styles that famous TED speakers implemented in their presentations. 

Overall the main lessons are summarized in 3 main sections (Emotional, Novel and Memorable) and 9 chapters in total:

1. "Say it with passion. Passion is contageous"
2. If you have to tell something, tell it with a story. -> Master the art of storytelling!
3. Have a conversation. You're not giving a lecture, your audience need to feel to be part of a dialogue. Behave and act as so.
4. The power of novelty. Our brain is designed and evolved to be triggered by novelty and pattern breakings. Novelty doesn't necessarely cover only the subject (i.e., _what_ you say) but also the medium and the approach (i.e., _how_ you say)
5. Deliver jaw-dropping moments; this will stamp a clear and memorable image in the minds of your audience
6. Lighten up! Don't be afraid to use some humour, but be careful to not overdo it. A bit of humor will make you more likeable, but if used wrong will create uncomfortable situations.
7. Convey your message as clearly as possible in the lowest amount of time. Only great speakers are able to summarize the content of one lifetime amount of research into 15 minutes. Attention drops quickly and you can't pretend your audience to listen to you for hours.
8. Let your presentation activate multisensory topics, hence activating different parts of the brain and creating a strong impression in your audience
9. Public speaking is an art and as such must be practiced before being mastered. Remember to alway be yourself. Authenticity is the key for creating a connection with your audience.

## Conclusions
By focusing on elements such as storytelling, authenticity, and audience engagement, the author reveals the key ingredients for delivering impactful presentations that leave a lasting impression. The part that I appreciated the most are the neuro-biological reasons that make an already good presentation a _great_ presentation.
